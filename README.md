# Python-Tools
A repository full of useful Python Tools
> Warning: ALl of these scripts are written for `Python 3.7`. While some of these scripts may work in `Python 2`, it is recommended that you use `Python 3`

## Ideas
1. JSON scrubber cli application, where the user can search through the keys and parse through it on the fly.
2. OpenCV object detection script
